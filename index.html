            <h2>Objective and Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The objective of this project is create a store website that has the ability to add/remove items from the cart using
                React. In addition, in order to make the shopping experience much easier for the customers, I will add filtering/sorting 
                option that will allow the customers to navigave through the items and find their needs sufficiently. The website
                I will be creating will be a sports shop.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Structure" class="bodyparagraph">
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>
                I will be using two components StoreItem and ShowCart. StoreItem will take the data and display each items on the store.
                ShowCart will be used similarly to display the items in the cart. Inside of the App, the data of all the avaliable items
                are stored in a constant variable so it can be accessed throughout the App. There will be total of 7 states handling
                variables such as cart items, filtering, sorting, and total price.
            </p>

        <div id="Item" class = "bodyparagraph">
            <h2>Displaying the Items</h2>
            <p>First step I took was displaying the items on the website. I stored the data in a constant variable so that it can
                be accessed throughout the App. Then, in the return statement, I rendered through the data and passed each item and
                a handleclick method to a StoreItem component as props. Handleclick function will be used with the button to update
                cart items and total price when adding or removing an item from the cart.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div id="Filter" class="bodyparagraph">
            <h2>Filtering and Sorting</h2>
            <p>For filtering, I decided to implement teams and types (jerseys, balls, cleats). When a button is clicked,
                the appropriate function will run depending on type of the button (teams, types, or price sorting). Since I am
                using states to keep track of both filters and sort type, combinations of different filters and sorting will
                execute together.

        <div id="Cart" class="bodyparagraph">
            <h2>Cart</h2>
            <p>Most of the cart codes were already completed in handleclick function. Cart, total price state are updated
                in the function. I used a ShowCart component to render through the cart and print out each item. At the bottom,
                total price will be printed out as well.
